# alexa-turn-server-on-off

Very simple and basic Node Express API project with two GET requests routes: /turnon turns on the home server with WOL technology; /turnoff turns off the server by accessing it via SSH connection.
This app was made up and running in a always-on Rasbpian environment (Raspberry Pi 4) by using PM2.
The home server is another host in the LAN home network so it's quite easy for the rPi to interact with it.

Enjoy! :)
